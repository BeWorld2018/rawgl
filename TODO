  - improve SDL backend
    * scalers (advmame2x, advmame3x)
    * print on-screen messages when doing quick load/save
      - SystemStub::displayInfo(const char *text, uint32 duration);
  - improve timing
  - support non interactive demo version (inputs are read from demo3.joy)
  - support non-pc platforms versions (3do)
  - rewrite video code to use OpenGL
  - avoid full screen refresh (dirty blocks ?)
  - rewrite the 'bypass protection' code
